  "description": "This is an interactive map of my mind I created using Genially. I model my consciousness as an infinitely expanding magical forest. Each part of the forest represents different learned concepts, memories, routines, etc., which all contain their own layers of ideas, associations, and examples. All parts flow through the central origin tree while sparkling streams, fairy trails, and wisps of magic connect concepts and their layers to other domains in the forest. Various guardian creatures roam, spreading magical seeds to make some areas flourish, while also leaving others to fade. Glittering rainbow light constantly flows into the forest, influencing what is already rooted and what expands.  ",
